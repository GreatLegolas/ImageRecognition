# ImageRecognition
My attempt to recognize image to perform a test task for potential employer.

To demonstrate the execution, the images are stored in the folder named 'imgs'. There should be also two folders named 'samplesNumbers' and 'samplesSuits' to hold samples. Besides these three folders, the executable file will be placed in the same folder.
Logically, areas in the images from the 'imgs' are compared with samples accordingly of suits and numbers. This comparation outs out appropriate symbols to form final result to show that suits of all cards on the desk.
